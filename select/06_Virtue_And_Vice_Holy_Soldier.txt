It's Funny How You Only See A Certain Side Of Me,
For I Am Just A Man Encaged In Who I'm Supposed To Be
Yes You Think You Know Me, But Just To What Degree,
I Can't Deny My Other Side My Secret Identity.

(Pre Chorus:)
Oh, The Things That People Say, Some Believe The Fantasy
But It's Really Not That Way,
Oh The Side You Never See, I Wish That I Could Show You
But You'd Probably Run From Me,
It's Like Dr. Jeckyl Meets Mr. Hyde
That's Who I Really Am Deep Down Inside

(Chorus:)

Virtue And Vice, Fire And Ice, Which One Is Really Me.
Virtue And Vice, Nasty And Nice, Tell Me Which One Will It Be.

A Civil War Is Raging In The Fortress Of My Mind,
Both Sides Hate The Other Evil And Divine.
I Guess That's Just The Way It Is The Nature Of The Game
And Until The Game Is Over, The Song Remains The Same.

(Pre Chorus:)

(Chorus:)
