Don't know what's being
misunderstood
Missiles flying, children
getting shot
Swindles everywhere
People who should be the most
loved ones, killing
each other
Once you keep an eye off, things
get stolen
The world is like this
The world we don't know
The unknown world
Out of our hands
It don't matter
Covering it up, acting like you
don't see a thing
If you think it's a defferent
thing
You won't notice that the world
you live in is
eventually hitting towards this
matter
Look at it
Oh yeah! The world is all linked
together
Save our loved ones and the
world
These peaceful days lasting is a
wish
Because I have no idea
How many tickets “to live
today” are
Even at the time when you were
playing cards
Somewhere in the world, somebody
is crying
Us to one
Let me hear your voice!
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi…
It still is way too quite!
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi…
We all have weaknesses
Losing against it is the end
Don't limit yourself
Got to change them
Raise your voice
To fight it out against your
weak self
We sure do gotta change theme
The raising worries, the falling
cold sweats on
the back
Backing off saying “can not
make it happen”
You really think ?
You really think ?
Shake it off and move on
Shake it off and move on
just you are my love Your
pure feeling
That beautiful voice It's so
valuable
I wanna stay with you, not only
tonight
The words that fell from you
Let us change it to connect
tomorrow
Let's sing until our voices die
There must be many walls
There must be times you will be
breaking down
